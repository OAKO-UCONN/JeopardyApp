# JeopardyApp
## Play Jeopardy with your friends and family with just a web browser!
### This is a Full Stack MERN Stack (MongoDB Express.js React.js Node.js) Web Application. It has a back-end, front-end, and noSQL database.
### Currently in development, the goal is to make it so it can work with many users online, not just on the same computer.

## Test it out!
